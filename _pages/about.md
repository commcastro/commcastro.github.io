Optical communications researcher with expertise in developing machine learning (ML)-based digital signal processing (DSP) solutions for transmission networks. My doctoral research focused on developing power-efficient equalisation schemes for next-generation optical transmission systems.

I am proficient in programming, algorithm design, simulations, and implementing custom ML models and DSP pipelines. I also have hands-on experience with experimental validation.
